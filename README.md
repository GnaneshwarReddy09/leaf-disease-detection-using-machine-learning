# leaf-disease-detection-using-machine-learning
Leaf disease detection using machine learning automates the identification of plant diseases through leaf images, eliminating the need for manual inspection. It uses techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and tools such as TensorFlow and OpenCV to analyze and classify diseases with high accuracy.
